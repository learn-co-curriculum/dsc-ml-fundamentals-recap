    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Inference*** and ***prediction*** are two different use cases for statistical modeling\n",
    "  * Linear regression can be used for both kinds of modeling\n",
    "  * While inference is most interested in understanding relationships in the data, prediction is most interested in ***generalization***, i.e. making good predictions on unseen data\n",
    "* ***Model validation*** techniques allow you to measure how well your model generalizes\n",
    "  * The two most popular validation techniques are ***train-test split*** (which randomly shuffles the data into a training set and a test set) and ***cross-validation*** (which splits the data into folds and uses one fold at a time as the test set)\n",
    "* Predictive modeling involves balancing between ***bias*** and ***variance***\n",
    "  * Bias is associated with ***underfitting*** and less-complex models\n",
    "    * An example of a less-complex model would be linear regression\n",
    "    * A high-bias model will perform poorly on both the training and the test data\n",
    "  * Variance is associated with ***overfitting*** and more-complex models\n",
    "    * An example of a more-complex model would be polynomial regression\n",
    "    * A high-variance model will perform well on the training data and poorly on the test data\n",
    "* ***Regularization*** is a technique to reduce overfitting\n",
    "  * Two popular penalized coefficient regularization techniques are ***ridge*** regression and ***lasso*** regression\n",
    "  * Lasso regression penalizes coefficients to 0, which means that it can be used for ***feature selection*** in addition to other feature selection techniques such as recursive feature elimination"
